Find a Data Story

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data! Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the comparison(s) or relationship(s) you want your readers to see.


## Design
Initially, based on my exploratory data analysis, I wanted to create massive blob-like clusters of the data (i.e., that would not have visualized each individual example): ![Initial Visualization](images/initial.png)


However, after 
receiving some feedback and reflecting, I decided to visualize each data point
using a bubble chart.

The student explains initial design decisions such as chart type, visual encodings, layout, legends, or hierarchy. These are included at the beginning of the Design section in the README.md file.

## Feedback
My feedback was mostly positive. Humorously, as more time passed, the feedback
continued to include more and more desired features, many of which I added 
(e.g., ).

What do you notice in the visualization?
What questions do you have about the data?
What relationships do you notice?
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?

The student collects feedback from at least three people throughout the process of creating the data visualization. The feedback is documented in the Feedback section of the README.md file.

The student presents evidence that the visualization has been improved since the first sketch or the first coded version of the visualization. The student has listed all of the feedback in the Feedback section of the README.md file. Most design choices and changes are accounted for in the Design section of the README.md file.
